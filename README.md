 <br>
Currently active and ongoing research: <br>
• Artificial Intelligence & AGI — architectures, limitations, convergence <br>
• Human perception, predictive processing, and inference <br>
• Structural and algorithmic isomorphisms across systems <br>
• Epistemic reliability and error correction through systems engineering <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Featured Work <br>
Plasma Pareidolia (Preprint) <br>
A working demonstration of the approach: a terrestrial, physics-based explanation of high-energy atmospheric anomalies, shaped by how the brain’s predictive processing interprets them. <br>
 <br>
The Method <br>
AMO (Adversarial Multi-Model Orchestration) is the engine behind this work — a research methodology designed to: <br>
01 Run multiple competing hypotheses in parallel. <br>
02 Force synthesis through structured disagreement. <br>
03 Compress iteration cycles from years into weeks. <br>
AMO is not automation. It’s a way of thinking and working. AI models and human orchestrators forming a collaborative intelligence for rapid hypothesis generation, critique, and synthesis. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The Results / Artifacts <br>
Case Study // The Seed <br>
Plasma Pareidolia <br>
From concept to hypothesis in 8 days. <br>
A unifying terrestrial framework addressing a large class of reported UAP phenomena. <br>

What I’m Building <br>
A small, open research collective organized around methods and artifacts, not credentials or institutions. <br>
 <br>
Current Value Proposition: <br>
 <br>
/  Direct Onboarding: Direct collaboration with the AMO founder on active research problems. <br>
/  Credit & Attribution: Your research. Your discoveries. Co-authored, citable outputs (DOIs). <br>
/  Zero Latency: Collaboration without gatekeeping or hierarchy. <br>
 <br>
The research has grown too big for one person. <br>
If you’re capable, curious, and ambitious, reach out. <br>
