Currently active and ongoing research:
• Artificial Intelligence & AGI — architectures, limitations, convergence
• Human perception, predictive processing, and inference
• Structural and algorithmic isomorphisms across systems
• Epistemic reliability and error correction through systems engineering


Featured Work
Plasma Pareidolia (Preprint)
A working demonstration of the approach: a terrestrial, physics-based explanation of high-energy atmospheric anomalies, shaped by how the brain’s predictive processing interprets them.

The Method
AMO (Adversarial Multi-Model Orchestration) is the engine behind this work — a research methodology designed to:
01 Run multiple competing hypotheses in parallel.
02 Force synthesis through structured disagreement.
03 Compress iteration cycles from years into weeks.
AMO is not automation. It’s a way of thinking and working. AI models and human orchestrators forming a collaborative intelligence for rapid hypothesis generation, critique, and synthesis.


The Results / Artifacts
Case Study // The Seed
Plasma Pareidolia
From concept to hypothesis in 8 days.
A unifying terrestrial framework addressing a large class of reported UAP phenomena.

What I’m Building
A small, open research collective organized around methods and artifacts, not credentials or institutions.

Current Value Proposition:

/  Direct Onboarding: Direct collaboration with the AMO founder on active research problems.
/  Credit & Attribution: Your research. Your discoveries. Co-authored, citable outputs (DOIs).
/  Zero Latency: Collaboration without gatekeeping or hierarchy.

The research has grown too big for one person.
If you’re capable, curious, and ambitious, reach out.
